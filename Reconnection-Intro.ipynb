    "# Motivation\n",
    "In this module we will discuss current computational methods to modeling plasmas. In particular, we will simulate an ubiquitous phenomena in laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasmas called magnetic reconnection. Additionally, in this module we will introduce a broad array of skills useful in computational physics which you may not have seen before: Git version control, shell commands, post-processing simulation data using Python. A variety of plasma models will be employed which span the space of both fidelity and computational complexity, from first-principles kinetic modeling to approximate fluid models like magnetohydrodynamics. We will aim to properly introduce these vital skills to students, taking care to cater to various levels of prior knowledge.\n",

    "## An overview of magnetic reconnection\n",
    "Magnetic reconnection is a process in which the magnetic topology is rearranged in the presence of a plasma. This topological rearrangement of the field lines is a mechanism of converting magnetic field energy to other forms of energy: heat, large scale plasma flows, and accelerating particles to very high energies. It is easiest to visualize this process with a pair of oppositely directed (antiparallel) magnetic field lines in a system that experiences high heat levels. One can think of the magnetic field lines snapping and \"reconnecting\" with other field lines in complete analogy with a rubber band snapping (*see the gif below*).  Common examples of this are coronal mass ejections and when the solar wind impacts the Earth's magnetosphere. Magnetic field lines have inherent tension, which act to straighten out magnetic field lines. When reconnection occurs, this force acts towards the center of curvature and pushes the plasma out, similar to a slingshot. We will discuss the source of tension later, but first we will find out what, mathematically, causes this process.\n",

    "## A deeper dive into magnetic reconnection\n",
    "We first start with the ideal Ohms Law equation for ideal non-resistive magnetohydrodynamic models $$ \\EE+\\VV\\times\\BB=0 $$ which describe systems that follow the frozen in theorem. The theorem states that without any resistivity in a fluid, the magnetic field is frozen in to said fluid. In a plasma this means that the magnetic field lines move with the plasma. Furthermore, the field will not change when moving along with the field lines, but motions transverse to the field carry the field with the motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive the frozen-in theorem by taking Ohm's Law and applying it to Faraday's Law, getting $$ \\frac{\\partial\\BB}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\VV \\times \\BB) - c\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\JJ) $$ since the current density J is proportional to $\\nabla\\times\\BB$ through Ampere's Law, we arrive at $$ \\frac{\\partial\\BB}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\VV \\times \\BB) + c\\eta (\\nabla^2 \\JJ) $$ after some simplifications, namely using the curl of a curl identity and that $\\nabla \\cdot B=0$ since there are no magnetic monopoles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma}$, where $\\mu_0$ is the permiability of free space as $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, when we look no resistivity/infinite conductivity, the $\\eta$ term in the magnetic field equation falls out and we are left with the induction equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the induction equation $$ \\frac{\\partial\\BB}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\VV\\times\\BB) $$ we use $\\Phi = \\int_s{\\BB\\cdot dS}$ to get $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_s{\\BB \\cdot dS}$$ \n",
    "The two ways the magnetic flux can change is through a change in the magnetic field strength $\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t}$ or a movement in the surface we integrate over. We can substitute the induction equation in for the first term and get $$ \\int_s{\\nabla\\times(\\VV\\times \\BB)\\cdot ds}+\\int_s{\\BB\\cdot (\\VV\\times d\\ell)} $$ The second term arises from movement on the surface of integration. We can use Stokes' Theorem and the vector identity $(A\\times B)\\cdot C = -B\\cdot (A\\times C)$ to get $$ \\int_c{\\VV\\times \\BB\\cdot d\\ell}-\\int_c{(\\VV\\times \\BB)\\cdot d\\ell} = 0 $$ \n",
    "Thus, we find that $\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_s{\\BB\\cdot ds}=0$, proving the frozen in theorem when we have no resistivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we introduce resistivity, Ohm's Law transforms into $$ \\EE+\\VV\\times \\BB=\\eta \\JJ $$ where $\\eta$ is the magnetic diffusivity, and the system no longer follows the frozen in theorem. This means that the magnetic field lines are no longer frozen to the plasma and can reconnect. "

    "## Modeling magnetic reconnection\n",
    "In order to talk about the models we must find all the physical properties to consider when generating a model and any approximations. First we start with the electron momentum equation for the ith component of the electric field $$ m\\frac{\\partial n\\ue}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{\\mathcal P} = nq(\\EE+\\ue\\times\\BB) $$ our goal is to end up with the generalized Ohm's Law equation which will play a key role in the future. In order to get there, we rearrange the electron momentum equation to get $E=\\frac{m}{nq}\\frac{\\partial n\\ue}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot\\overleftrightarrow{\\mathcal P}-\\ue\\times\\BB$.  The u in the term is electron flow, so we can subsitute in $$ \\ue=-\\frac{\\JJ}{q_sn_s}+\\ui$$ where J is current density and $\\ui$ is ion flow. With this information we get $$-\\ue\\times\\BB=(\\frac{\\JJ}{q_sn_s}-\\ui)\\times\\BB=\\frac{\\JJ\\times \\BB}{q_sn_s}-\\ui\\times \\BB$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $\\overleftrightarrow{\\mathcal P}$ (stress tensor) term, we can substitute in the equation of the tensor involving reynolds stress $$\\overleftrightarrow{\\mathcal P}=\\PT+\\rho \\ue\\ue$$ Now we are left with $$E+\\ui\\times \\BB=\\frac{\\JJ\\times \\BB}{nq}+\\frac{1}{nq}\\frac{\\partial nm\\ue}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\nabla\\cdot\\PT}{nq}+\\frac{\\nabla\\cdot nm\\ue\\ue}{nq}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine the time derivative of momentum and divergence of Reynolds stress using product rule, so $$\\frac{\\partial nm\\ue}{\\partial t}=nm\\frac{\\partial\\ue}{\\partial t} + \\ue\\frac{\\partial nm}{\\partial t}$$ $$\\nabla\\cdot (nm\\ue\\ue) = \\ue\\nabla\\cdot(nm\\ue)+nm\\ue\\cdot\\nabla\\ue$$ Resulting in $$nm(\\frac{\\partial \\ue}{\\partial t}+\\ue\\cdot\\nabla \\ue)+\\ue(\\frac{\\partial nm}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot (nm\\ue))=nm(\\frac{\\partial \\ue}{\\partial t}+\\ue\\cdot\\nabla \\ue)$$ since the second term equals 0 due to mass conservation $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot (\\rho u) = 0$. \n",
    "Now we can switch back to vector notation to look at the electric field as a whole and plug in our new expression for the electron inertia contribution, arriving at $$ \\EE+\\ui\\times \\BB=\\eta \\JJ+\\frac{\\JJ\\times \\BB}{nq}-\\frac{\\nabla \\cdot \\PT}{nq}+\\frac{m}{q}[(\\frac{\\partial \\ue}{\\partial t}+\\ue\\cdot\\nabla\\ue)] $$\n",
    "where the left hand side comes from the ideal MHD, the $\\eta J$, $J\\times B$, and $P_e$ terms are known as the resistive dissipation, hall and the pressure tensor terms, respectively.\n",
    "(**Expand on tension**)\n",
    "### 5 moment models\n",
    "In this computational demo we will start with the 5 moment simulation, which symplifies the pressure tensor down to a scalar. This is Eulers equations shown below, where the force is Lorentz force $$ \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot (\\rho\\us) = 0 $$ \n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial\\rho\\us}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot (\\rho\\us\\us+p_s\\II) = q_sn_s (\\EE+\\us\\times\\BB)$$ \n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{E}_s}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot([\\mathcal{E}_s+p]\\us)=q_sn_s\\us\\cdot\\EE $$ \n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{E}_s=\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_s|\\us|^2+\\frac{p_s}{\\gamma-1} $$ \n",
    "These equations represent the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, respectively, where the total energy is $\\mathcal{E}_s$ and the adiabatic index of an ideal fluid $\\gamma$ is 5/3 for hydrogen plasma. \n",
    "Then we will expand the tensor out and compute the 10 moment simulation. Normally, only including the resistive dissipation term causes reconnection to occur far too slowly to only be attributed to the physics. But the hall term and the divergence of the pressure tensor causes the simulations to reconnect much more faster, closer to real life phenomenon. The hall term alone causes the reconnection rate to be comparable to the Alfvén speed, while \"at small values of resistivity the dissipation region forms an elongated Sweet-Parker layer and the rate of reconnection is very low, with an inflow velocity $v_i$ into the X line which scales like $v_i=\\frac{\\delta}{\\Delta}v_A<<v_A$, where $\\delta$ and $\\Delta$ are the width (controlled by resistivity) and length (macroscopic) of the dissipation region, respectively, and $v_A$ is the Alfven velocity\" [Birn et al., 2001] as illustrated by the GEM reconnection challenge results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, 5 moment models simplify the pressure tensor down to a scalar. The 5 moment model is in fact a generalization of the Hall-MHD model (taking Ohm's law until the hall term) which can be found from the 5 moment model by approximating the speed of light to be infinite. By simplifying the pressure tensor, the 5 moment model is significantly easier to run, but can be an inaccurate model outside of the reconnection zone.\n"

Now that we briefly showed how to view output through the command line, lets take a look at creating python scripts to do the postprocessing. We will be using a tool (**Cite Jason**) called pgkylFrontEnd to do so. First, clone the repository below."

Now that we have gone over an example, lets move on to plotting reconnecting fluxes in the 'fluxPlotNotebook' file. "
