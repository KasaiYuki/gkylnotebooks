    "# Motivation\n",
    "In this module we will discuss current computational methods to modeling magnetic reconnection. This is motivated by the fact that many students studying this field are poorly taught the computational skills needed to succeed in this field. From more broad skills like using Git version control and plotting in Python, to more narrow knowledge of magnetohydrodynamic equations, we will aim to properly introduce these vital skills to students, taking care to cater to various levels of prior knowledge.\n",

    "## Understanding Magnetic Reconnection\n",
    "Magnetic Reconnection is a process when the magnetic topology is rearranged in the presence of a plasma. This causes a burst of energy in the form of heat, kinetic energy for electrons and ions, large scale plasma flow. When this occurs, the magnetic field lines snap and connect with the other field lines (*see the gif below*). Magnetic field linesare frozen into the plasma. Since plasma is a highly conductive material and field lines have inherent tension, (reconnection is intutitive due to tension, nontrivial since ideal plasmas cant reconnect) \n",

    "## How does magnetic reconnection occur\n",
    "Magnetic reconnection occurs with a pair of oppositely directed magnetic field lines. It occurs when the system experiences high heat levels of heat. A common example of this are coronal mass ejections and when the solar wind impacts Earth's magnetosphere.\n",
    "## How do we model magnetic reconnection?\n",
    "(start with ideal ohms law, frozen in theorem, nonideal plasma cause reconnection\n",
    "We start with the generalized Ohm's Law $$E+u\\times B=\\eta J+\\frac{J\\times B}{n|e|}-\\frac{\\nabla \\cdot P_e}{n|e|}\\times [\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial t}+\\nabla \\cdot (uJ+Ju-\\frac{JJ}{n|e|})]$$, where the left hand side comes from the ideal Ohm's Law, the first term on the right hand side is known as the resistive dissipation term. The $J\\times B$ term is called the hall term, and $P_e$ is known as the pressure tensor (**EXPAND**). The last portion of the equation is derived from electron inertia.\n",
    "In this computational demo we will start with the 5 moment simulation, which symplifies the pressure tensor down to a scalar. This is Eulers equations where the force is lorentz force (write eulers equations with general force, F=E+(VxB) which is 0 in an ideal plasma. In generalized ohms law, there are other terms, called nonideal terms, that cause reconnection) Then we will expand the tensor out and compute the 10 moment simulation. Normally, only including the resistive dissipation term causes reconnection to occur far too slowly to only be attributed to the physics. Instead at that rate, the numerics of the simulation cause reconnection. This can be explored in the Apendix.\n",
    "### 5 moment models\n",
    "As mentioned before, 5 moment models simplify the pressure tensor down to a scalar. The 5 moment model is in fact a generalization of the Hall-MHD model (taking Ohm's law until the hall term) which can be found from the 5 moment model by approximating the speed of light to be infinite. By simplifying the pressure tensor, the 5 moment model is significantly easier to run, but can be an inaccurate model outside of the reconnection zone.\n"
