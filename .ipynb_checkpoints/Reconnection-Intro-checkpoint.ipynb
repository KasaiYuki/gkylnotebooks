    "# Motivation\n",
    "In this module we will discuss current computational methods to modeling magnetic reconnection. This is motivated by the fact that many students studying this field are poorly taught the computational skills needed to succeed in this field. From more broad skills like using Git version control and plotting in Python, to more narrow knowledge of magnetohydrodynamic equations, we will aim to properly introduce these vital skills to students, taking care to cater to various levels of prior knowledge.\n",

    "## An overview of magnetic reconnection\n",
    "Magnetic reconnection is a process when the magnetic topology is rearranged in the presence of a plasma. This causes a burst of energy in the form of heat, kinetic energy for electrons and ions, large scale plasma flow. When this occurs, the magnetic field lines snap and connect with the other field lines (*see the gif below*). Magnetic reconnection occurs with a pair of oppositel directed (antiparallel) magnetic field lines in a system that experiences high heat levels. Common examples of this are coronal mass ejections and when the solar wind impacts the Earth's magnetosphere. Zooming out a bit, magnetic field lines have inherent tension, which act to straighten out magnetic field lines. When reconnection occurs, this force acts towards the center of curvature and pushes the plasma out, similar to a slingshot. (**discuss tension more**)\n",

    "## A deeper dive into magnetic reconnection\n",
    "We first start with the ideal Ohms Law equation for ideal non-resistive magnetohydrodynamic models $$ E+u\\times B=0 $$ which describe systems that follow the frozen in theorem. The theorem states that without any resistivity in a fluid, the magnetic field is frozen in to said fluid. In a plasma this means that the magnetic field lines move with the plasma. Furthermore, the field will not change when moving along with the field lines, but motions transverse to the field carry the field with the motion. When we introduce resistivity, Ohm's Law transforms into $$ E+u\\times B=\\eta J $$ where $\\eta$ is the magnetic diffusivity, and the system no longer follows the frozen in theorem. This means that the magnetic field lines are no longer frozen to the plasma and can reconnect. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive the frozen-in theorem by taking Ohm's Law and applying it to Faraday's Law, getting $$ \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (V \\times B) - c\\nabla \\times (\\eta J) $$ since the current density J is proportional to $\\nabla\\times B$ through Ampere's Law, we arrive at $$ \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (V \\times B) + c\\eta (\\nabla^2 J) $$ after some simplifications, namely using the curl of a curl identity and that $\\nabla \\cdot B=0$ since there are no magnetic monopoles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ \\eta = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma} $, where $\\mu_0$ is the permiability of free space as $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, when we look no resistivity/infinite conductivity, the $\\eta$ term in the above equation (**give reference**) falls out and we are left with the induction equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the induction equation $$ \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (V \\times B) $$ we use $ \\Phi = \\int_s{B \\cdot dS}$ to get $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_s{B \\cdot dS}$$ \n",
    "The two ways the magnetic flux can change is through a change in the magnetic field strength $\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t}$ or a movement in the surface we integrate over. We can substitute the induction equation in for the first term and get $$ \\int_s{\\nabla\\times(v\\times B)\\cdot ds}+\\int_s{B\\cdot (v\\times d\\ell)} $$ The second term arises from movement on the surface of integration. We can use Stokes' Theorem and the vector identity $ (A\\times B)\\cdot C = -B\\cdot (A\\times C) $ to get $$ \\int_c{v\\times B\\cdot d\\ell}-\\int_c{(v\\times B)\\cdot d\\ell} = 0 $$ \n",
    "Thus, we find that $\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_s{B\\cdot ds}=0$, proving the frozen in theorem when we have no resistivity."

    "## Modeling magnetic reconnection\n",
    "In order to talk about the models we must find all the physical properties to consider when generating a model and any approximations. First we start with the electron momentum equation for the ith component of the electric field $$ m\\frac{\\partial nu_i}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{P}_{ij}}{\\partial x_j} = nq(E_i+\\epsilon{_{ijk}}u_jB_k) $$ our goal is to end up with the generalized Ohm's Law equation which will play a key role in the future. In order to get there, we rearrange the electron momentum equation to get $E_i=\\frac{m}{nq}\\frac{\\partial nu_i}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{P}_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}-\\epsilon{_{ijk}}u_jB_k$ and simplify the $\\epsilon$ term. Feel free to read up on Einstein notation, but for this demo we will cover the nessessary translations. The u in the term is electron flow, so we can subsitute in $$ u_e=-\\frac{J}{q_sn_s}+u_i$$ where J is current density and $u_i$ is ion flow. With this information we get $$-\\epsilon{_{ijk}}u_jB_k=-u\\times B=(\\frac{J}{q_sn_s}-u_i)\\times B=\\frac{J\\times B}{q_sn_s}-u_i\\times B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $\\mathcal{P}$ (stress tensor) term, we need to find the divergence over the j index, since $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{P}_{ij}}{\\partial x_j}=\\nabla\\cdot\\mathcal{P}$ (**fix notation if needed**). We can substitute in the equation of the tensor involving reynolds stress $$\\mathcal{P}_{ij}=P_{ij}+\\rho u_iu_j$$ where $u_iu_j=\\sum_j{u_iu_j}$ for $i,j=\\{x,y,z\\}$. Now we are left with $$E_i+u_i\\times B=\\frac{J\\times B}{nq}+\\frac{1}{nq}\\frac{\\partial nmu_i}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\nabla\\cdot P}{nq}+\\frac{\\nabla\\cdot nmu_iu_j}{nq}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine the time derivative of momentum and divergence of Reynolds stress using product rule, so $$\\frac{\\partial nmu_i}{\\partial t}=nm\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial t} + u_i\\frac{\\partial nm}{\\partial t}$$ $$\\nabla\\cdot (nmu_iu_j) = u_i\\nabla\\cdot(nmu_j)+nmu_j\\cdot\\nabla u_i$$ Resulting in $$nm(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial t}+u_i\\cdot\\nabla u_j)+u_i(\\frac{\\partial nm}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot (nmu_j))=nm(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial t}+u_i\\cdot\\nabla u_j)$$ since the second term equals 0 due to mass conservation $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot (\\rho u) = 0$. \n",
    "Now we can switch back to vector notation to look at the electric field as a whole and plug in our new expression for the electron inertia contribution, arriving at $$ E+u\\times B=\\eta J+\\frac{J\\times B}{nq}-\\frac{\\nabla \\cdot P_e}{nq}+\\frac{m}{q}[(\\frac{\\partial u_e}{\\partial t}+u_e\\cdot\\nabla u_e)] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " where the left hand side comes from the ideal MHD, the $\\eta J$ term is known as the resistive dissipation term. The $J\\times B$ term is called the hall term, and $P_e$ is known as the pressure tensor (**EXPAND**).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this computational demo we will start with the 5 moment simulation, which symplifies the pressure tensor down to a scalar. This is Eulers equations where the force is lorentz force (write eulers equations with general force, F=E+(VxB) which is 0 in an ideal plasma. In generalized ohms law, there are other terms, called nonideal terms, that cause reconnection) Then we will expand the tensor out and compute the 10 moment simulation. Normally, only including the resistive dissipation term causes reconnection to occur far too slowly to only be attributed to the physics. Instead at that rate, the numerics of the simulation cause reconnection. This can be explored in the Apendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5 moment models\n",
    "As mentioned before, 5 moment models simplify the pressure tensor down to a scalar. The 5 moment model is in fact a generalization of the Hall-MHD model (taking Ohm's law until the hall term) which can be found from the 5 moment model by approximating the speed of light to be infinite. By simplifying the pressure tensor, the 5 moment model is significantly easier to run, but can be an inaccurate model outside of the reconnection zone.\n"
